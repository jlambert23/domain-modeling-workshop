# POS can be rejected

- when they're rejected they move to a new "rejected" state
- a notification is sent to the submitter
- a rejected PO can be modified by the original submitter and resubmitted
- if a rejected PO is resubmitted with no changes then it must include an "override reason" to explain why the rejection was in error
- When a rejected PO is resubmitted it will be important for the new reviewer to know that this was previously rejected, when it was rejected, and by whom
